# Oregon Adventures

## Usage
It is an app to view and book different adventure packages in Oregon. Users can scroll up and down to view the packages that have a description and the gear they should bring for the trip.

There is an input number field at the bottom of each adventure card where users can select how many participants they would like to book and a message will pop up confirming how many people they have booked and that an email will be sent to them. If they try to book more than 10 people for a single trip, it will say that the booking is full.

At the bottom of the page, there is a form for users to submit their email and ask a question if they would like. There is also an image with a heading called "Gallery" that will be turned into a clickable link in the future.
